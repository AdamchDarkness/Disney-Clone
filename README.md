I'm excited to share with you my latest project: a Disney+ clone that I developed using React for the user interface and Firebase for authentication. As a web development and cinema enthusiast, this project allowed me to combine my two interests and put my technical skills into practice.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
- React: For creating an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- Firebase: To manage user authentication securely and efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- Intuitive and responsive user interface.
- Secure authentication with sign-up and login via Firebase.
- Organized and easily navigable movie catalog.

This project provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen my frontend development skills while working on a concrete and relevant application in the streaming domain.
I invite you to watch this short video where I showcase the different features of this application. Feel free to share your feedback and ask me any questions about the technical aspects or the challenges I encountered!
